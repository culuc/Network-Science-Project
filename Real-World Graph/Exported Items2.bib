	abstract = {The increasing impact of fossil energy generation on the Earth ecological balance is pointing to the need of a transition in power generation technology towards the more clean and sustainable Renewable Energy Sources ({RES}). This transition is leading to new paradigms and technologies useful for the eï¬€ective energy transmission and distribution, which take into account the {RES} stochastic power output. In this scenario, the availability of up to date and reliable datasets regarding topological and operative parameters of power systems in presence of {RES} are needed, for both proposing and testing new solutions. In this spirit, I present here a dataset regarding the German 380 {KV} grid which contains fully {DC} Power Flow operative states of the grid in the presence of various amounts of {RES} share, ranging from realistic up to 60\%, which can be used as reference dataset for both steady state and dynamical analysis.},
